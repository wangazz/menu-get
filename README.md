# "What's hall??"

The cry of hungry Somervillians everywhere. This program uses Selenium to automatically log on to the Somerville meal bookings system, parse the menu for the week, and return the options in hall for any given meal on a given day of the week.

Future plans:
- Add a GUI
- Create a email newsletter whereby the day's meal options will be sent out to subscribers each morning

Special thanks to the creators of:
- Selenium
